# Conrad

This is a LEGO EV3 script made to compete in robot battles (think sumo matches) that my school held

But I needed a name for this killer machine, so I ended up naming it **Conrad**

I went with a tank build that flips over the other robots

Although he lost the battle, he won the war, the war of love, he will forever be #1 in my heart
